This repository contains three separate Python console applications, each designed to demonstrate core programming concepts including input/output processing, file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), inheritance, polymorphism, validation, and problem-solving skills.
These tasks were developed as part of a midterm project.
1. Calculator Application

A simple console-based calculator that allows a user to perform the four basic arithmetic operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

The program includes:

Input validation

Safe division (prevents division by zero)

🏧 2. ATM Simulation System

A full console simulation of an ATM machine supporting:

Multiple users

PIN-based authentication

Balance checking

Deposits

Withdrawals

Persistent storage using a .txt file

File handling for saving user data

🎓 3. Student Management System

A console program to manage student information with features:

Add new students

View all students

Search students by roll number

Update student grades

OOP principles implemented:

Classes and objects

Inheritance (Person → Student)

Polymorphism (display_info override)

Encapsulation with properties and getters/setters

This task demonstrates structured program design and object-oriented modeling.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python 3

OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation)

File handling (.txt files)

Console-based user interfaces
